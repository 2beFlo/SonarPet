## Features

* Lightweight and simple plugin that can easily be incorporated into donator perks
* Entities are custom made and therefore more controlled and monitored by the plugin
* Entities focus on their owner and are not interrupted by any nearby interfering mobs
* All pets are invincible and some have adapted abilities from other species
** For example, Iron Golem Pets are mobile in water and do not sink
* Each pet has access to a wide range of options related to their appearance and the server owner has complete control over which options are allowed.

## Obtaining A Pet

Using the command **/pet** EchoPets can be easily spawned in to walk by your side until you choose to remove them. Some EchoPets can be altered by adding in data to the command. For example, wool colours on sheep.

Data values are often specific to different mob types and can be accessed using the **/pet list <mob-type>** command. To spawn in an EchoPet, use **/pet <type>:[data]**. More than one data value can be specified by separating them with a comma. Certain EchoPets can also have mounts, specified in the optional second argument of the Pet command:

**/pet cow:baby sheep:lime,baby** would spawn a baby cow EchoPet with a lime baby sheep riding it.

Players must have the appropriate permissions for **both** the pet and the mount. All pets can have mounts.

## Data Usage

### MCStats

Since 1.3, EchoPet has been sending small amounts of information to MCStats.org so that the amount of servers using the plugin can be tracked. It's nothing to be worried about. Here are the results! =D

### Auto-Updater

EchoPet comes with an [[http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/updater-easy-safe-and-policy-compliant-auto-updating-for-your-plugins.96681/|auto-updater]] to save you, as a server owner, from continually checking this page for new files. It simply connects to dev.bukkit.org and compares the versions of available files. If you **do not** wish for EchoPet to perform this check, navigate to the Configuration File (config.yml) in the EchoPet directory of your plugins folder and change "checkForUpdates" and "autoUpdate" to "false". The first value disables the version comparison altogether and the second updates the plugin automatically if new files are detected.

## Got An Issue? Create A Ticket!

The Multi-World issue experienced in versions before EchoPet 2 has been resolved. Pets are now able to travel between dimensions and worlds without any problems, and will not become lost in Nether Portals.
